  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>OwnershipChange</Name>
    <Description>Application Control detects if a trusted file is changed by a non trusted owner. If that is the case the file owner is changed to the untrusted user and any execute requests will be blocked. Certain applications overwrite files in such a way that Application Control does not detect it by default therefore the owner of the file is not changed. Enabling the ‘OwnershipChange’ setting means Application Control performs additional checks and all file changes/overwrites should be caught.

A value of 1 is required to enable this setting.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>ExplicitShellProgram</Name>
    <Description>Used by Application Access Control. Application Control treats the launch of the shell program (by default Explorer.exe) to indicate that a session has logged on. Different environments and technologies can change the shell program and sometimes Application Control cannot identify it. Application Control will use the programs in this list (in addition to the default shell program) to determine when a session has logged on. This is a semi-colon delimited list of full paths or filenames.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>DisableDNSLookup</Name>

  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>EnableScriptPreCheck</Name>
    <Description>Scripts within scripted rules take time to run. How long scripts take depends on the content of the script. AM treats any script that has not yet finished as if it has already returned a ‘false’ result. This gives the best performance during computer start-up and user logon as anything depending on the result of a script won’t be held up. To instead cause processes depending on the result of a script to wait until the relevant script has finished, set this value to “1”. Setting this can significantly slow down computer start-up and user logon.&#13;&#10;Note: AM will not wait indefinitely for scripts results. A 30 second timeout will be applied.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>EnableSignatureOptimization</Name>
	  <Description>This setting improves the performance of rules checking, when using signatures. Files that do not match the full path will not be hashed, as we assume they are not the same file. A value of 1 enables this setting. Enabling ExtendedAuditInfo along with this setting will not show any hashed filename in auditing metadata.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>ComputerOUThrottle</Name>
    <Description>This setting limits an Active Directory look-up per connecting client, for checking Organizational Unit membership, by a limiting the number of concurrent queries. This throttling is to help reduce the amount of query-traffic on a domain if handling a large volume of connecting clients. Set this value to 0 upto 65535.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>  
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>DFSLinkMatching</Name>
    <Description>Set this value to 1 to enable DFS Link matching. DFS Link paths can be added to the rules. DFS Links are treated as separate independent items to be matched.

  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>AMFileSystemFilterFailSafe</Name>
    <Description>This setting configures whether the file system filter driver operates in a Fail Safe or Fail Secure mode. If there is a problem with the Application Control agent and it stops responding, the driver disconnects in Fail Safe mode and does not intercept anymore requests. A value of 1 indicates Fail Safe, 0 indicates Fail Secure. Fail Safe is the default. Note: Changing this setting requires an Application Control agent restart for the change to take effect.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
      <Name>ADComputerGroupMembershipTimeoutSecs</Name>
      <Description>Timeout (in seconds) when doing nested computer group lookups. Default setting is 120 seconds. Setting this value to 0 disables the timeout.</Description>

When this setting is used, the level is reduced to medium. This value should be a semi-colon delimited list of file names.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
   <CustomSetting>
    <Name>ADQueriesEnabled</Name>
    <Description>This setting controls the types of AD queries used to determine the system's Distinguished Name and computer group membership. A value of 0 disables queries made to AD and also disables the use of computer groups and OU in the configuration. The default value of 1 causes the Application Control agent to perform both the Distinguished Name and direct (non-nested) computer group AD queries. Nested computer groups in the configuration are ignored. A value of 2 causes the agent to perform the Distinguished Name, direct and nested computer group AD queries. This setting could cause performance issues on the DC due to high CPU usage.</Description>
  </CustomSetting>
  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>SelfElevatePropertiesEnabled</Name>

  <CustomSetting>
    <Name>AssumeActiveSetupDespiteCitrix</Name>
    <Description>With Citrix clients using published applications, Window's Active Setup is not run as part of the Citrix client logon. By default, Application Control detects that the client is using a Citrix protocol and then assumes Active Setup is excluded so that blocked applications will never be allowed under circumstances that may look like Active Setup. In addition, and optionally, Application Control can impose a more stringent check for Citrix being involved: set the value of this setting to 1 so that Application Control imposes the more stringent check if it appears that denied applications are being allowed in these circumstances. Set the value to 2 to stop Application Control from making these 'Citrix' checks at all if applications appear to be blocked during a real Active Setup.</Description>
